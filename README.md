#### My name is Benjamin, and I'm a student at 42 Perpignan, France. <br>
#### In general I'm a bit of a perfectionist, I love the challenge of perfect completion, so much that I validated all my 42 Common Core projects with perfect score ! <br>

## Check out all of my 42 Common Core projects in [this repository](https://github.com/Thawnder/42).

## I also worked on Delta: The Fallen Kingdom, check out the [website](https://delta-fallen-kingdom.odoo.com/) !
