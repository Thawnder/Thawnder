## Introduction

#### My name is Benjamin, and I'm a student at 42 Perpignan, France. <br>
#### In general I'm a bit of a perfectionist, I love the challenge of perfect completion, so much that I validated all my 42 Common Core projects with perfect score ! <br>

### Check out all of my 42 Common Core projects in [this repository](https://github.com/Thawnder/42). <br> <br>

## Games I worked on
  
### I worked on a free mobile game called [CRISPR Crunch](https://playcurious.games/our-games/crispr-crunch/), and that gave me a bit of experience with the TypeScript language. <br>

### I also worked on [Delta: The Fallen Kingdom](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deltaprojectvr/delta-the-fallen-kingdom-vr-rpg-coop-adventure/description?ref=recommendation-projectpage-footer-3). Unfortunately, this project was abandoned, but I had a blast working on it. I already worked on small "tutorial - getting the hang of Unity" things, but this was the first big Unity project I ever worked on. <br>
