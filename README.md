## Introduction

#### My name is Benjamin, and I'm a student at 42 Perpignan, France. <br>
#### In general I'm a bit of a perfectionist, I love the challenge of perfect completion, so much that I validated all my 42 Common Core projects with perfect score ! <br>

### Check out all of my 42 Common Core projects in [this repository](https://github.com/Thawnder/42). <br> <br>

## You can also find my professional work in [my portfolio](https://benjaminpleutin.myportfolio.com/).
